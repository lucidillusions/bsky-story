We are a little over three weeks in May, and less than a week from my Birthday. It has been a spectrum of weird to interesting month. Weird because after a long time no active new assignments panned out, but I managed to write a whole lot of things.

There are a lot of new stories I wrote this month. A bunch of those you can read for free on the [Short Stories](https://ss.lucidillusions.in/). A quick list down here.
1. The Great Molasses Flood
2. The Thirteenth Crab
3. When the Stars Misalign
4. The Eternal Setting Sun
5. The Dark Roast
6. The Shadow Realm.

Apart from this I also wrote [Thirty Six Frames](https://www.patreon.com/posts/thirty-six-128869863) which is available on my Patreon page, for members. Even free members yes. I'll mostly share it on here later in June. Yes, planning to gatekeep some of my stories for Patrons before sharing them freely.

Talking of locked content, I also finished [The Age of AI](https://ss.lucidillusions.in/shortstory/2025/04/08/AgeOfAI.html) with two extra parts, that is available on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/age-of-ai-127804028) as well. I'm not sure if I would be making this one open for public anytime soon.

Apart from these stories that I've shared online, I wrote The Fourth Estate, and sent it out as an entry to [Dark n Light Magazine](https://darknlight.com/event/stories-at-the-end-of-the-world/)'s Stories at the End of the World contest.

So in 3 weeks I have 9 stories that I've shared online, 3 stories in the work, 2 of which I feel like can be 5k-10k words long, so they will definitely take a while.

Like I mentioned, the month has been crappy, so if you can, please [support me on Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/lucidillusions), or check [Darkroom for Photo Prints](https://lucidillusions.darkroom.com/), and [RedBubble for Art Merch](https://www.redbubble.com/people/lucidillusions/shop).

p.s. If you're reading this post, you're obviously on the website, and in case you missed it, I have updated it with some extra features. The blog section is new, and I'm hoping this helps me be more regular with my thoughts, and other antics. I'm planning to write a blog describing the updates, and maybe link to some of the blogs that helped me add these features.
