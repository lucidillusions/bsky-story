&nbsp; Karl Jackson ran his gloved hand over the cave wall. A wide grin broke through the mud caked on his face. His entire career had been an uphill battle against the established geological community. They had laughed at his theories of non-terrestrial minerals forming in deep-earth fissures, a concept they called "sci-fi nonsense." He'd been searching for it for years, a compound he'd tentatively named Karluminium. This cave was his last chance.

His headlamp beam finally settled on a seam of black ore that pulsed with a dull, inner light. It wasn't just sharp; its edges were a perfect, repeating fractal geometry that defied all known natural processes. The serrated protrusions weren’t random; they spiralled inwards, all converging around a perfectly circular hole in the cave floor—an impossibly perfect absence in the rock.

A gentle rhythmic hum began in his skull, a vibration that felt less like sound and more like a thought being forced into his mind. He chipped off a sample, and the sharp edges of the ore vibrated against his glove. Even through the layers, he could feel heat being emitted by this small piece. He looked into the circular hole, a void that seemed to swallow all light, and saw the toothed patterns on the ore shift, aligning with an unseen presence in the abyss.

A low growl echoed up from the depths, not of rockfall, but of an entity organic and vast. The entire cave began to tremble, and the circular hole widened.  Something groaned as the jagged edges of the mineral began rearranging themselves into a new, terrifying structure. Karl stumbled back, his mind finally understanding. This wasn't a geological formation; it was a biological one. This wasn't a cave; it was a maw.

A single point of milky white light, veined with black, flickered in the abyss. It wasn't an eye, but a nascent pupil. It began to swell, regarding him not with curiosity, but with the cold, patient hunger of something that had waited for an eon. The ore sample in his hand began to glow with a sickly red hue, and Karl felt a horrifying, searing pain in his mind. His thoughts were getting splintered, and consumed. He had found the ultimate geological specimen, and it was about to add his screaming consciousness to its collection.
