&nbsp; The flickering neon sign of 'The Bird of Paradise' cast a pretty pink glow on Lauren as she stepped out,  the lingering taste of their home-brewed ale still on her tongue. The night air, usually thick with the scent of smog and rain, held a strange, metallic tang tonight. She barely noticed until a ripple in the alleyway caught her eye. It wasn't a rat scampering around, but a shimmering, almost liquid distortion of reality itself.

A figure coalesced from the distortion, tall and gaunt, with eyes that seemed to drink the moonlight. Lauren, a seasoned brawler from the docks, squared her shoulders. "Looking for trouble, pal?" she grunted, cracking her knuckles.

The figure didn't answer, but a tendril of shadow snaked out, impossibly fast, and wrapped around her arm. It wasn't painful, not at first, but it felt... wrong. Like her very atoms were being rearranged. She pulled back, surprised by its strength, and countered with a jab to what she assumed was its chest. Her fist connected, not with flesh, but with a yielding, yet unyielding, surface that hummed with an internal cold.

The fight that ensued was a blur of instinct and improbable physics. The figure moved with impossible grace, its limbs elongating and contracting, its form subtly shifting. Lauren dodged a blow that crumpled the steel fence behind her, rolled under a sweep that twisted the air above her, and landed a kick that sent ripples through the opponent's body like dropping a stone in still water. Each of her attacks, though seemingly ineffective, was met with a strange resonance that vibrated deep within her bones.

She found herself smirking, as she tried to grasp what was happening. This wasn't just a fight; it felt like a dance, a terrifying, exhilarating exchange of forces. Her opponent, silent and enigmatic, seemed to mirror her intensity, its movements growing more fluid as well as more intricate. The alleyway itself seemed to warp around them, the brick walls breathing, the distant city lights stretching into impossible lines.

Then, just as she ducked under a shimmering arm that now seemed to possess too many joints, something in the figure's form snapped into focus. Not its physical shape, which remained unsettlingly mutable, but the scale of it. The way the shadows stretched infinitely behind its shifting silhouette. The way its eyes, now vast, swirling nebulae, contained the cold, indifferent fire of a thousand distant suns. The way the alleyway wasn't actually warping, but simply revealing its true, infinitesimal place in a cosmos that dwarfed her understanding.

Her next kick, aimed at its midsection, landed not on a body, but on the very fabric of existence. The impact was not physical, but existential. It was then, in that awe-inspiring but terrifying moment, that the realization crashed down on her like a collapsing star. This wasn't some beefed-up street thug, or even a particularly nasty demon.

This was a force beyond mortal comprehension, an antecedent of the cosmos that had witnessed the birth and death of nebulae, a sculptor of the grand tapestries of galaxies. This was an ancient, cosmic architect, a being of such unfathomable scale and antiquity that its casual glance could unravel realities. Yet, for a purpose unknown and perhaps unknowable, it chose to express a mere fraction of its boundless essence within the confines of a grimy alley. For a brief, dizzying moment, the infinite horror of its true self brushed against the mundane, orchestrating an exchange both profound and sickeningly glorious. This was an eldritch god.

The revelation wasn't fear, not exactly. It was a dizzying, overwhelming sense of infinitesimal wonder. Her battle, rather, her paltry, human struggle, had been acknowledged by a cosmic entity. It hadn't been a battle of strength, but a momentary intersection of realities.

A profound, almost religious ecstasy washed over her as she saw how the entirety of her life was but a tiny shining thread in an unfathomably vast tapestry. And for a fleeting moment, that thread had brushed against the divine.

Her legs buckled. Not from a blow, but from the sheer, uncontainable glory of the understanding. She didn't fall to the ground, but into a swirling abyss of silent, shimmering awe. The alleyway, the city, the very concept of 'The Bird of Paradise' vanished, leaving only the endless, star-strewn gaze of her unfathomable opponent, and the echo of a truly magnificent, utterly insignificant battle.

As Lauren floated down the abyss, she heard a guttural sound, "You've been chosen."
