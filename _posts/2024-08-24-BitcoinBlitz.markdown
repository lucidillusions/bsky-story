Shreyan was a young man, enjoying his simple life, which also involved occasionally touching grass. He was a software engineer, content with his modest apartment and the gentle rhythm of his days.

One day he posted
"hi guys send some bitcoin to my wallet just for fun ðŸ¤—"

And the next morning, a notification from his cryptocurrency wallet jolted him awake.

Millions. Millions worth of bitcoins.
No explanation, no warning, just a windfall that defied logic. But the universe, it seemed, was not generous without a caveat. A cryptic message followed the transaction: "Spend 10% in the next 10 hours. No investments, no assets. Spend them on experiences only."

Panic set in. Ten percent of what he received was still in millions. But what could one do with that kind of money in ten hours? The world was a vast, glittering bazaar of experiences, but to pick and choose in such haste was a daunting task.

A flight to the other side of the world seemed the most efficient use of time. Europe, with its ancient cities and vibrant cultures, promised a whirlwind of experiences. A private jet was booked, the fastest available.

In the heart of Europe, he stumbled upon an advertisement that made his jaw drop. A service offered the rental of fighter jets. The price tag was astronomical, a figure that would have made his pre-bitcoin self faint. But now, while it felt merely a rounding error, he realised it might help put a dent in the 10%.

Soaring through the sky, the clouds whipping past him, adrenaline coursing through his veins, Shreyan felt a sense of freedom heâ€™d never known. He was a bird, a comet, a conqueror of the skies.

The world below shrank, transformed into a patchwork quilt of greens and blues. But as the jet crossed the infamous Bermuda Triangle, something strange happened. The world seemed to shimmer, to distort. A moment of disorientation, and then, nothing.

He fell. Fell through a void of blackness, a space devoid of time and gravity. And as the world spun into oblivion, a final thought crossed his mind: perhaps the universe had not been so generous after all.
