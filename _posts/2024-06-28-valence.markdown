Right then, let's delve into this chilling tale of scientific discovery and cosmic horror. Here's the proofread version with consistent verb tenses and British English spellings, along with explanations for the changes:

Within the cavernous belly of the defunct power plant, Dr. Evelyn Kessler stood before the control panel. Dust motes danced in the shaft of her flashlight, illuminating a scene of decay. The air, heavy with the metallic tang of rust, held a different kind of weight too - the weight of a forgotten dream. Her eyes, once bright with scientific curiosity, were now haunted—etched with the knowledge that could unravel the world.

The valence reactor, a relic from a forgotten era, hummed ominously. Its core pulsed with energy, each electron transition felt less controlled and more like a heartbeat on the verge of arrhythmia. Dr. Kessler had discovered the truth—the reason behind inexplicable meltdowns, the whispers of malevolence that echoed through the corridors.

Her trembling fingers trailed across the equations scrawled on the grimy chalkboard, desperately connecting the dots that stretched across space and time.

The valence transitions weren’t mere physics; they were conduits for something ancient and hungry. With every tiny leap, an unseen force stirred—a malefic presence that fed on fear, anger, and despair.

The Chernobyl disaster—the world had blamed it on human error, but Dr. Kessler knew better, now. The reactor’s valence cascade had torn a rift, allowing the malevolence to seep through. The technicians, unsuspecting, had become vessels for its wrath. The screams of the dying that echoed in her nightmares.

Now, in this forsaken place, she sought answers. The control rods trembled as she adjusted them, trying to stabilise the reactor. But the malevolence resisted—a sentient force that defied containment. It whispered promises of forbidden knowledge, of dominion over reality itself.

Dr. Kessler’s colleagues had vanished one by one. Their eyes glazed, mouths spouting gibberish—the malevolence claimed them. She had glimpsed its form—an eldritch geometry that twisted sanity. It hungered for release, and the valence transitions were its gateway.

As midnight approached, the reactor’s glow intensified. Dr. Kessler hesitated. She could shut it down, seal the rift forever. But the malevolence whispered in her mind, promising answers to questions she hadn’t dared ask. The world’s suffering, the weight of existence—could she bear it alone?

She stepped closer, her breath ragged. The valence cascade surged, and the room quaked. Shadows writhed, coalescing into tendrils that reached for her. The equations burned in her vision—the key to understanding, the price of damnation.

And then, with a scream that echoed through time, Dr. Kessler plunged her hand into the reactor core. The malevolence surged, engulfing her. She glimpsed other worlds—twisted, broken—where civilisations crumbled under its influence. It hungered for chaos, entropy, oblivion.

The reactor exploded, a blinding flash that consumed everything. Dr. Kessler became one with the malevolence, her consciousness fracturing across dimensions. She whispered secrets to the void, her voice carried on cosmic winds.

The world mourned the loss of the brilliant scientist. They blamed it on a reactor malfunction, never suspecting the eldritch truth. But sometimes, in the dead of night, a flicker of malevolence stirs—a reminder that evil isn’t always born of human hearts.
