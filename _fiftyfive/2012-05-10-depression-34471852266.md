Reek ! Stepping in. Reading the letter. I couldn’t stop laughing. Everyone stared back at me. All I could do was laugh. The letter, as always, carried bad news. My best friend died and I was laughing. Everyone thought I was mad, I won’t blame them.

When depressed I laugh ‘cause tears bring me no respite.
