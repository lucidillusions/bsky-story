Spanked.
She cries.
Eyes open gently.
People staring at her.
She looks back at them.
Them smiling with tears of joy.
She blinks not knowing what to say.
Few years pass, she observes everything, says nothing.
One fine day she tries and fails, tries again.
Finally she swoons as she utters her first word “Mama”.
