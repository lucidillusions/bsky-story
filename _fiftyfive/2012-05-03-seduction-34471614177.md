Smile. Those lips. Those beautiful eyes. They catch me soon. I look away, but reluctantly. My inside full of fluttering butterflies.

I feel a tap on my shoulder. I am in love; seduced by her smile. Takes my hand; we dance ; the song now forever ours. She a Bridesmaid, I the Best-man, a love story begins.
