Hugs. A kiss. Eight hours spent. Waited for a month. Months before they meet again. A tear rolls down her cheek. He picks his bags, boards his train. Twenty five hours. travelling, back to his city. He calls her, she cries and says “I’m Sorry.”

They meet after six months just to say their Goodbyes.
