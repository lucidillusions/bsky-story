Chemistry ~ Sparks fly.

A beautiful smile ~ When their eyes meet.

Both shy, self proclaimed introverts ~ If it wasn’t for the drinks.

She leads him beyond her bedroom doors ~ He holds her close and kisses her lips .

The drinks acts like a catalyst, weaves a magic  ~ And magic as we know always comes with a price
