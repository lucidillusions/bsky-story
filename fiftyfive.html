<p>
    Dive into a unique collection of micro-fiction, where every story is
    precisely fifty-five words long. This project was started on twitter by
    Vivek Tetuja (u/vivekisms) where he would give a prompt everyday, and users
    would send him a story, which were compiled daily on a site. This here are
    the stories that I wrote, sometimes I even asked friends to give me prompts
    for me to write. If you look through these stories, you will observe various
    challenges that I put myself through while writing these at times.
