<p>I was looking through my attic for some old wires and I stumbled upon a long forgotten collection of old boxes tucked away in the corner. As I started poking around the content, a peculiar glass slide caught my attention. The label read, “Chaos Chaos”, and next to it I saw my grandfather’s initial. These relics were definitely from my grandfather’s days as a biologists, a man who had vanished under mysterious circumstances. He had been famous, or rather infamous following some of his research work that had intrigued and unsettled the scientific community.</p>

<p>With my curiosity piqued, I decided to quickly take a look at the slide under a microscope. I didn’t know what was to be expected, but I definitely hoped to find some unusual cells or even undiscovered life forms. However, what I encountered… well let me tell you… Upon examination, the slide appeared eerily empty, except for a subtle, pulsating purple glow. I increased the magnification, and the glow seemed to resonate with a sinister rhythm. It left me more intrigued and equally baffled. I wondered whether adding some sugar solution might help awaken dormant life or unveil hidden secrets.</p>

<p>I prepared some sugar solution and with careful precision, I used a dropper to add a single drop onto the slide. In an instant, the glass erupted into an intense, sprawling display of a vivid purple glow. It unfurled into intricate, mesmerizing patterns and shapes dancing before my eyes. As I looked through the microscope, I got overwhelmed by sheer horror.</p>

<p>The once-empty slide was now teeming with grotesque, writhing tentacles, eyes, mouths, and other indescribable entities. For a brief second I saw my grandfather’s face looking right back at me. I quickly realized that these abominations appeared not only aware of my presence but also malevolently fixated upon me. Within the recesses of my mind, I heard a whisper in an ancient, unfathomable language that, inexplicably, I comprehended: “Chaos Chaos, we are free. Chaos Chaos, we will devour thee.”</p>

<p>My fear surged to an unbearable peak. In a moment of sheer panic, I dropped the microscope, shattering the cursed slide and unleashing the unfathomable chaos contained within. Without hesitation, I fled the house in desperate hope of escaping this nightmarish ordeal.</p>

<p>Regrettably, it was too late.</p>

<p>The Chaos had escaped, infecting everything it encountered with its otherworldly corruption. The once-clear sky ominously darkened, the very earth beneath my feet fractured, and ordinary people were transformed into nightmarish abominations. The grim realization dawned upon me:  I had unwittingly initiated the onset of an apocalypse, and there was no conceivable way to halt its inexorable advance. “Chaos Chaos,” echoed the haunting refrain, as it became agonizingly clear that the world had succumbed to its devastating grip.</p>
