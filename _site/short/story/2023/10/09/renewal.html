<p>In the cosmic realm of the Eldritch Gods, a minion named Pintling was facing a peculiar problem. The God’s godly license was about to expire, and without it, their power would be locked behind the celestial Power-as-a-Service model.</p>

<p>Pintling, a diligent minion, was tasked with the renewal process. He had to navigate through the labyrinthine bureaucracy of the cosmic realm, dealing with celestial clerks and divine paperwork. The Eldritch God’s power was waning with each passing moment, and Pintling could feel the urgency.</p>

<p>The journey was fraught with challenges. Pintling had to answer riddles posed by the Sphinx of Time, negotiate with the Bargainer of Eternity, and even face the dreaded Auditor of the Abyss. But Pintling persevered, his determination fueled by his loyalty to his master.</p>

<p>Finally, after what felt like eons, Pintling stood before the Cosmic Registrar. With a trembling hand, he handed over the divine paperwork.</p>

<p>The Registrar scanned it with eyes that held galaxies within them. After an agonizing wait, he shook his head. “Renewal denied,” he declared in a voice that echoed through time and space.</p>

<p>Pintling was shocked. He had followed every rule, completed every task. It turned out that the denial was due to a celestial clerical error - a mistake in the cosmic bureaucracy that was no fault of Pintling’s.</p>

<p>Pintling’s heart sank. Despite his best efforts, he had failed. He returned to his Master with heavy steps and delivered the news. The Eldritch God’s reaction was swift and terrifying.</p>

<p>In his disappointment and rage, the Eldritch God consumed Pintling in one swift motion. His last thought was regret for his failure as he disappeared into the cosmic abyss.</p>

<p>And so ended the tale of Pintling, a cautionary tale echoing through the cosmos about the dire consequences of failure in the service of an Eldritch God - even when it wasn’t your fault.</p>
