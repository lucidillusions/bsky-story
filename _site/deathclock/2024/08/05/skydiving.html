<p>Gilbertine was not an adrenaline junkie. She preferred the quiet comfort of her armchair embroidering on a weekend, to the thrill of anything remotely resembling excitement. But her best friend, a whirlwind of energy and impulsiveness, had convinced her that a tandem skydive would be a “once-in-a-lifetime experience.” Gilbertine had envisioned the “experience” as a leisurely picnic with Bollywood movies being projected on a big screen… not plummeting towards Earth at terminal velocity.</p>

<p>As the plane climbed, Gilbertine’s grip on the instructor’s harness tightened. The ground, once a familiar patchwork quilt, now resembled a menacing abyss. The moment of truth arrived sooner than she’d liked. With a shove that felt like a betrayal, she was plummeting towards the ground.</p>

<p>The parachute didn’t open.</p>

<p>A scream, ripped from her throat as the wind whipped past her face. Gilbertine’s last thought, a bizarrely calm one considering her situation, was, “Well, this is going to be a really expensive funeral.”</p>

<p>As fear, pure and unadulterated, consumed her. It was in that moment of abject terror that an ancient, cosmic entity, bored beyond comprehension, noticed.</p>

<p>In the cosmic void, an ancient, bored entity was idly flipping through dimensions. Its existence was a monotonous loop of nothingness until it was drawn to the intense, raw fear emanating from Earth. Curiosity piqued, it reached out to investigate.</p>

<p>Before Gilbertine could even process the horror of her situation, a tendril of cosmic evil reached out. It wasn’t drawn to her physical form, but to the essence of her terror.</p>

<p>And then it sneezed.</p>

<p>Not just any sneeze. This was a cosmic sneeze, a cataclysmic event that ripped a hole in the fabric of reality. Through this breach, a slimy, tendril-like substance oozed into our world. Tiny at first, it began to grow at an alarming rate, its appetite insatiable.</p>

<p>And so, Gilbertine, the woman who preferred tea to turbulence, became the unwitting harbinger of cosmic doom. It was, in the grand scheme of things, a truly awful way to spend an afternoon.</p>
