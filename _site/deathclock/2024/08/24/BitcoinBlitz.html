<p>Shreyan was a young man, enjoying his simple life, which also involved occasionally touching grass. He was a software engineer, content with his modest apartment and the gentle rhythm of his days.</p>

<p>One day he posted
‚Äúhi guys send some bitcoin to bc1qgmxv6u9s6amcmq2yu34fjrh9322ej4mksn53gz just for fun ü§ó‚Äù</p>

<p>And the next morning, a notification from his cryptocurrency wallet jolted him awake.</p>

<p>Millions. Millions worth of bitcoins.
No explanation, no warning, just a windfall that defied logic. But the universe, it seemed, was not generous without a caveat. A cryptic message followed the transaction: ‚ÄúSpend 10% in the next 10 hours. No investments, no assets. Spend them on experiences only.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Äì</p>

<p>Panic set in. Ten percent of what he received was still in millions. But what could one do with that kind of money in ten hours? The world was a vast, glittering bazaar of experiences, but to pick and choose in such haste was a daunting task.</p>

<p>A flight to the other side of the world seemed the most efficient use of time. Europe, with its ancient cities and vibrant cultures, promised a whirlwind of experiences. A private jet was booked, the fastest available.</p>

<p>In the heart of Europe, he stumbled upon an advertisement that made his jaw drop. A service offered the rental of fighter jets. The price tag was astronomical, a figure that would have made his pre-bitcoin self faint. But now, while it felt merely a rounding error, he realized it might help put a dent in the 10%.</p>

<p>‚Äì</p>

<p>Soaring through the sky, the clouds whipping past him, adrenaline coursing through his veins, Shreyan felt a sense of freedom he‚Äôd never known. He was a bird, a comet, a conqueror of the skies.</p>

<p>The world below shrank, transformed into a patchwork quilt of greens and blues. But as the jet crossed the infamous Bermuda Triangle, something strange happened. The world seemed to shimmer, to distort. A moment of disorientation, and then, nothing.</p>

<p>He fell. Fell through a void of blackness, a space devoid of time and gravity. And as the world spun into oblivion, a final thought crossed his mind: perhaps the universe had not been so generous after all.</p>
